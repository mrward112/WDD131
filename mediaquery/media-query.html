            <h2>Alma 26:12</h2>
            <p>Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my
            God, for in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which
            we will praise his name forever.</p>

            <h2>Heleman 5:12</h2>
            <p>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye
            must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind,
            yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the
            gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation
            whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p>
